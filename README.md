# City Power Loadshedding Schedule API

Quick and dirty API that exposes the City Power 2 hour loadshedding schedule found [here](https://www.citypower.co.za/customers/Load%20Shedding%20Related%20Documents/City%20Power%20load%20shedding%20schedule%20February%202021.pdf)

This is a Node.js Azure Function using TypeScript, but the logic could be easily copied into any JS framework.

**Disclaimer:** It's very possible that the schedule will be changed and this could become out of date.
